## Installation
1. Clone your dotfiles into a bare repository in a "dot" folder of your $HOME:
```git clone --bare <git-repo-url> $HOME/.cfg```
2. Define the alias in the current shell scope:
```alias config='/usr/bin/git --git-dir=$HOME/.cfg/ --work-tree=$HOME'```
3. Checkout the actual content from the bare repository to your $HOME:
```config checkout```

The step above might fail with a message like:
```error: The following untracked working tree files would be overwritten by checkout:
    .bashrc
    .gitignore
Please move or remove them before you can switch branches.
Aborting```

This is because your $HOME folder might already have some stock configuration files which would be overwritten by Git. The solution is simple: back up the files if you care about them, remove them if you don't care.

4. Set the flag showUntrackedFiles to no on this specific (local) repository:
```config config --local status.showUntrackedFiles no```

done!
